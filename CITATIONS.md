## Data Availability Statement (Template for Paper)

### Suggested Text

> **Data Availability:** The Uber Movement travel time data used in this study was obtained from the Uber Movement platform (movement.uber.com) in March 2022, prior to the platform's discontinuation. Uber Movement provided aggregated, anonymized travel time data for Nairobi, Kenya, covering the period from 2016-Q1 to 2020-Q1. As the platform is no longer operational, this specific dataset is not publicly accessible. Processed distance matrices (mean travel times and standard deviations) derived from the Uber Movement data will be made available upon publication at [repository URL]. Flare operational data is proprietary and subject to partnership confidentiality agreements; aggregated statistics are reported in the paper. The data processing code is available at https://github.com/[username]/ems-platform.

## Acknowledgments

### Data Providers

- **Uber Technologies:** For making Movement data available for research purposes (2017-2022)
- **Flare:** For providing operational EMS data under research partnership
- **Uber Open Source:** For maintaining the H3 spatial indexing system

### Data Collection

- Original Uber Movement data: Aggregated from Uber ride GPS traces in Nairobi
- Flare incident data: Collected through operational EMS dispatch system
- Data anonymization: Performed by Uber (Movement) and research team (Flare)

**Document End**

**Note to Researchers:** Given the discontinuation of Uber Movement and potential link rot, it is recommended to:
1. Archive local copies of all cited PDFs and web resources
2. Use DOIs when available for permanent reference
3. Document access dates for all web resources
4. Consider uploading processed datasets to academic repositories (Zenodo, Figshare, etc.) for long-term preservation
